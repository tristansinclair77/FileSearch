Implement these changes:
2) I want to add a preview panel that displays the image if the file I mouse over in the data grid is an image file. You choose where to put this; we can move it later.
4) Allow drag & drop for the select folder section, where dragging a folder into that area sets it as the current folder.


Update the README.md with the changes/adjustments from this task if necessary.
