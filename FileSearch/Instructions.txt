Implement these changes:
2) I want to add a preview panel that displays the image if the file I mouse over in the data grid is an image file. You choose where to put this; we can move it later.
3) Next to the select folder button, add a "recent folders" dropdown that lists the last 5 folders I have searched in. Selecting one of these should set that folder as the current folder again. This dropdown's list should be saved as a temporary file; we don't need to persist it.
4) Allow drag & drop for the select folder section, where dragging a folder into that area sets it as the current folder.


Update the README.md with the changes/adjustments from this task if necessary.
